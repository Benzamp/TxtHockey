Console Text-Based Hockey Game

A console text-based hockey game.

Create a team is not working yet since I have been working on the team and player generation plus game logic.

I have a file listing cities, one for mascots, and some for first and last names. I select from these lists at random to create player objects and add them to team objects.

The game play is not that fun and unfair as of right now, but I'll be working on it.

type "faceoff" to take the faceoff "pass" to pass "shoot" to shoot "skate" to skate

The more plays you compete without a turnover, the higher chance you have of scoring. This resets on a turnover.

Each player also has random stats for shoot, passing, skating, and faceoffs.

As of right now, its 3v3 hockey.

Generally, Center takes faceoffs and blocks passes, wing scores goals, and defense blocks shots and passes. This is barely the case as of right now and will be one of my goals going forward.
